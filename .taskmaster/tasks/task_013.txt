# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Certificate Generation Engine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7, 12
# Priority: high
# Description: Build automated PDF certificate generation with client-specific formats and country flag branding
# Details:
Create src/lib/certificate-generator.ts using react-pdf or similar. Support client-specific certificate number formats (CERT-BRA-2025-0001, CA-25-001). Include lab country flag branding (Brazil for Brazil lab, Peru for Peru lab). Generate professional PDF layout with Wolthers branding, green color scheme. Sections: header (logo, lab info, cert number), sample details (all contract numbers, tracking info), quality assessment results (screen distribution, defects), cupping results (aggregate/average scores to closest increment), signatures (digital signature, QR code, auth code). Multi-language support (EN, PT, ES). Create src/app/api/certificates/generate/route.ts.

# Test Strategy:
Test PDF generation quality, test client-specific formatting, test country flag integration, test multi-language support, verify authentication codes

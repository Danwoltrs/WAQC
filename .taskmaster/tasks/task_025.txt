# Task ID: 25
# Title: Optimize Performance and Add Mobile Enhancements
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 21, 22
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement performance optimizations and mobile/tablet enhancements for lab operations
# Details:
Implement performance optimizations: pagination for sample lists (50 per page), localStorage caching for quality templates/defect definitions/client configs, lazy loading for sample galleries, debounced search inputs (300ms), database indexing for sample_tracking_number/client_id/status/created_at/quality columns. Virtual scrolling for storage grid with 3,024 samples capacity. Mobile/tablet enhancements: touch-optimized cupping interface, responsive sample intake form, tablet-specific storage grid interface, progressive enhancement for mobile features. Add service worker for offline capability preparation. Implement Redis caching strategy planning for Phase 3.

# Test Strategy:
Test performance with large datasets, test mobile interface usability, test offline capability, verify caching effectiveness, measure page load times

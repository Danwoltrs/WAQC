# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Origin-Specific Taints and Faults System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build system for configuring taints and faults per origin with client-specific customization options
# Details:
Create src/components/quality/taints-faults-config.tsx for lab managers to configure per-origin taints (Brazil: Harsh, Grassy/green, Woody, Past crop, Fruity, Dirty) and faults (Hard riado, Phenol rio, Fermented, Earthy, Moldy). Support client-specific customization of severity levels and point deductions. Create src/app/api/taint-fault-definitions/route.ts. Integration with cupping interface for defect recording. Version tracking for changes to taint/fault definitions.

# Test Strategy:
Test taint/fault CRUD operations, test origin-specific configurations, test client customization, verify integration with cupping interface

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Database Schema for Taint/Fault Definitions [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement database tables for storing origin-specific taints, faults, severity levels, and client customizations with proper relationships and constraints
### Details:
Create tables: taint_fault_definitions (id, origin_id, type, name, default_severity, default_deduction), client_taint_fault_customizations (client_id, definition_id, custom_severity, custom_deduction), taint_fault_versions (definition_id, version, changes, created_at). Include proper foreign keys, indexes, and RLS policies. Support for versioning changes to definitions.

I'll analyze the codebase to understand the current database structure and implementation patterns before enhancing the schema details.Based on my analysis of the current database schema in `/database/migrations/003_phase2_schema_TABLES_ONLY.sql`, I can see the existing structure for the `taint_fault_definitions` table and related components. Here's the enhanced schema specification:

Expand taint_fault_definitions table to include multi-language support: Add name_en TEXT NOT NULL, name_pt TEXT, name_es TEXT for English (required), Portuguese, and Spanish translations. Add scale configuration: default_scale TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '1-10' (values: '1-5', '1-7', '1-10'), default_increment DECIMAL(3,2) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0.25 (values: 0.25, 0.5, 1.0) to replace the severity_levels JSONB approach with structured scale fields. Add tolerance_distinction BOOLEAN DEFAULT false to separate taints from faults in tolerance counting.

Enhance client_taint_fault_customizations table with additional fields: Add custom_scale TEXT (allows client to override default scale), custom_increment DECIMAL(3,2) (custom increment override), max_acceptable_score DECIMAL(4,2) (threshold per taint/fault beyond which sample fails). These fields reference the existing custom_severity and custom_deduction fields.

Create taint_fault_translations table for future extensibility: id UUID PRIMARY KEY, definition_id UUID REFERENCES taint_fault_definitions(id) ON DELETE CASCADE, language_code VARCHAR(2) NOT NULL (ISO 639-1), translated_name TEXT NOT NULL, UNIQUE(definition_id, language_code). This supplements the direct name_en/pt/es columns and supports additional languages later.

Update existing indexes to include new fields: Modify idx_taint_fault_global_unique to include name_en instead of name for consistency. Add separate indexes on name_pt and name_es for search performance. Add index on default_scale and tolerance_distinction for filtering queries by scale type and taint vs fault distinction.

## 2. Build Taints and Faults Configuration Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create React component for lab managers to configure origin-specific taints and faults with severity levels and point deductions
### Details:
Implement src/components/quality/taints-faults-config.tsx with tabs for different origins (Brazil, Colombia, etc.), editable tables for taints and faults, severity level dropdowns, point deduction inputs, add/remove functionality, and save/cancel actions. Include validation for required fields and proper error handling.

## 3. Implement API Routes for Taint/Fault Management [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create REST API endpoints for managing taint/fault definitions, client customizations, and version tracking
### Details:
Create src/app/api/taint-fault-definitions/route.ts with GET (fetch definitions by origin), POST (create new definitions), PUT (update existing), DELETE endpoints. Include src/app/api/client-taint-fault-customizations/route.ts for client-specific overrides. Implement proper error handling, validation, and audit logging for changes.

## 4. Build Client-Specific Customization Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2, 10.3
### Description: Create interface for clients to customize severity levels and point deductions for their specific requirements
### Details:
Extend taints-faults-config.tsx with client selection dropdown, customization overlay showing default vs custom values, client-specific save functionality, and inheritance visualization. Include reset to defaults option and change history view for transparency.

## 5. Integrate Taint/Fault System with Cupping Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2, 10.3, 10.4
### Description: Modify existing cupping interface to incorporate origin-specific taints and faults for defect recording during cupping sessions
### Details:
Update cupping components to load appropriate taint/fault definitions based on sample origin, add defect recording section with severity selection and automatic point deduction calculation, integrate with cupping score calculations, and ensure real-time updates during collaborative sessions.

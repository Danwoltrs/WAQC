# Description: Build visual storage grid interface for Santos HQ lab with 72 positions supporting 42 samples per position (3,024 total capacity)
# Details:
Create src/components/storage/storage-grid.tsx with visual representation of Santos HQ layout: Shelf 1 (6x3 front left), Shelf 2 (6x3 front right), Shelf 3 (4x3 back right), Shelf 4 (8x3 back left). Each position holds 3 stacks Ã— 7 tins front/back = 42 samples. Implement drag-drop sample placement, real-time occupancy display, color coding by sample age (green <7 days, yellow 7-30, red >30). Add sample hover preview, search functionality, storage history tracking. Support for other lab configurations (Buenaventura, Guatemala, Peru) with flexible shelf layouts.

# Test Strategy:
Test storage allocation/deallocation, test visual grid performance with 3,024 samples, test drag-drop functionality, verify capacity calculations

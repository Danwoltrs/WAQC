# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create comprehensive sample intake form with client auto-detection, quality assignment, and contract number tracking
# Details:
Create src/components/samples/sample-intake-form.tsx with multi-step wizard: Basic Info (exporter autocomplete, buyer, roaster, origin, processing method, sample type), Tracking Numbers (all contract fields with validation), Quantity (M/T display priority, bag types), Sample Details (arrival date, photo upload, notes). Implement client auto-detection based on exporter/buyer names. Add quality specification auto-assignment. Include form state persistence to prevent data loss. Make responsive for desktop/tablet. Add real-time validation against client database.

# Test Strategy:
E2E tests for complete intake flow, test form state persistence, test file upload functionality, test client auto-detection accuracy
